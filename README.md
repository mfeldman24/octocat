Here are a couple paragraphs about myself:
I am a first year at Lehigh and I am math major. I tried to learn how to code last year through a coding program called, "Girls Who Code," but I was extremely unsuccessful. Though I found coding very difficult I still think it's interesting and impressive to do. Of course I have tried to hack my way though my senior year quizzes, but I never quite got to that level of coding. I am not the most technologically savy, so this type of learning takes me a while to pick up, but I am intrigued nonetheless.
My time here is spent mostly studying for calculus exams which can get a little tedious, but I still have found some time to enjoy myself. I have signed up for the ultimate frisbee club, an investment managament club, and my personal favorite: chocolate club. I'm excited to eventually particpate in these clubs in person, but for now there are just a few zoom meetings to figure out the logistics for the year. I can't wait for frsibee club to start up because I loved playing ultimate frisbee with my track and field team in high school, and I think my skills imporved greatly over the past year. I am still more excited though, to sit around and eat chocolate with new friends.
